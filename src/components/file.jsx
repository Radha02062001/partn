         <h2>  <img src={Image}/> Insurance for you and your family</h2>
   <p>It's very important that our Delivery Partners and their near and dear<br/> ones are cared for and looked after.
      That is why, <br/>all PDPs and their families are covered under both Medical insurance and Accident Insurance.<br/>
           The sum total of the insured amounts is Rs.1,00,000 (one lakhs).</p>
           <h2>  <img src={Image}/> Incredible Incentive</h2>
           <p>An incentive is a bullet,a key:an often tiny object with astonishing<br/>
           power to change a situation.I was very excited about a currency that was not controlled<br/>
           by a central goverment, that could be a free market currency. <br/>
           That was all the incentive i needed to dedicated my life to it.</p>
           <h2>  <img src={Image}/> Rewards</h2>
           <p>One industry that offers an incredible range of perks and incentives to<br/> its employees is software development.
            Silicon Valley is loaded with companies<br/> that provide everything from free food to massages to its employees.</p>
            <h2>  <img src={Image}/> Your Second Home</h2>
            <p> Our partners are our family, and any of the PDPs will tell you about the special moments<br/> 
            they spend with the our family of managers and fellow PDPs,celebrating major festivals together, <br/>
            regular meetings to share experiences and building valuable friendships.</p>
